# Real_time_video

## INTRODUCTION

Real-time Video Capture using OpenCV in Python is a project that uses the OpenCV library in Python to capture real-time images from the computer's camera. This project is useful for those interested in image processing and machine learning, as it provides a solid foundation for working with cameras and real-time video.

## OVERVIEW

This project uses the OpenCV library in Python to open the computer's camera and capture real-time images. The image is displayed in a visualization window, which continuously updates while the program is running. The user can close the program at any time by pressing the "q" key. This project provides a solid foundation for those looking to expand their knowledge in image processing and machine learning.
